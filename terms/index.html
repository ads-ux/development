                <h3>Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the applicable
                    laws of Canada and these laws apply to the use of the website by you, notwithstanding your domicile,
                    residency or physical location. The website is intended for use only in jurisdictions where it may
                    lawfully be offered for use.</p>
                <p>General Provisions These Terms and Conditions, including any documents referenced herein, constitute
                    the entire agreement between Vrume and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
                    all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written,
                    between you and Vrume with respect to the website. A printed version of these Terms and Conditions
                    and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative
                    proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms and Conditions to the same extent and subject to
                    the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
                    printed form. Vrume' failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these
                    Terms and Conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any provisions or right. If any of the
                    provisions contained in these Terms and Conditions are determined to be void, invalid or otherwise
                    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such determination shall not affect the
                    remaining provisions contained herein.</p>

                <h3>Personal Information</h3>
                <p>Your submission of personal information is governed by our Privacy Policy. To view our Privacy
                    Policy, please contact us.</p>

                <h3>COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK NOTICES</h3>
                <p>All rights reserved. No part of the site may be reproduced, modified, distributed, sold, published,
                    broadcast, retransmitted or circulated in any form without the prior written consent of Vrume,
                    except to the extent that such use is for your personal, non-commercial use. Any rights not
                    expressly granted herein are reserved.</p>

                <h3>Refunds</h3>
                <p>At Vrume, all payments are final and non-refundable. Once funds are added to your account or a
                    payment is made, they cannot be refunded, reversed, or credited — even if your campaign, account, or
                    service is paused, cancelled, or terminated.</p>

                <h4>Why No Refunds</h4>
                <p>Vrume operates on a prepaid model, and funds are committed to platform operations and advertising
                    delivery once payment is received. Because of this, we're unable to reverse or refund payments after
                    processing.</p>

                <h4>What This Means</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unused balances, advertising spend, platform fees, taxes, chargebacks, or promotional credits
                        (including bonuses, coupons, or goodwill credits) are not refundable.</li>
                    <li>Vrume may suspend or terminate access to services in cases of misuse, unauthorized activity, or
                        violation of our Terms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Account Balances</h4>
                <p>If a user's account reflects a zero or negative balance, Vrume reserves the right to apply (offset)
                    any credits, payments, or other amounts otherwise payable to the user against such outstanding
                    balance. Services may be suspended or withheld until the account balance is positive.</p>
